Recent surveys document growing dissatisfaction with the accounting
publication process, with researchers believing acceptance rates should
nearly double and that top journals increasingly favor narrow
methodologies. The conventional explanation attributes these problems to
reviewer bias. We offer an alternative: the statistical properties of peer
review---specifically, low inter-rater reliability combined with
multi-dimensional conjunctive evaluation---produce systematic dysfunction
that disadvantages quality research even without bias. Using a simulation
calibrated to empirical reliability data (ICC = 0.34), we demonstrate that
at realistic selectivity levels, approximately 45% of deserving papers are
rejected due to measurement error alone. This error structure creates
perverse incentives: researchers maximize expected publications by producing
multiple moderate-quality papers rather than single excellent papers. Our
findings reframe the conversation from "reviewers are biased" to "the system
is structurally noisy," pointing toward different remedies than those
typically proposed.

* Introduction

Recent surveys reveal growing dissatisfaction with the accounting
publication process. cite:woodComparingPublicationProcess2016 found that
accounting academics perceived very low citation patterns relative to other
disciplines and believed the review process was deteriorating.
cite:burtonPerceptionsAccountingAcademics2024 updated this survey and found
perceptions have only worsened: the rising generation of scholars holds even
more negative views than their predecessors, respondents believe acceptance
rates should nearly double, and there is widespread concern that top
journals favor narrow methodologies while underweighting practice relevance.
Perhaps most troublingly, cite:burtonWeMatterAttention2021 documented that
accounting research receives significantly less attention from policymakers
and the public than economics, finance, and other disciplines.

These patterns raise fundamental questions about whether the peer review
process is functioning effectively. The common explanation for publication
difficulties centers on reviewer /bias/---topic preferences, methodological
prejudice, or personal networks that systematically disadvantage certain
work. While bias undoubtedly exists, we offer a complementary explanation
grounded in measurement theory: the statistical properties of peer
review---specifically, low inter-rater reliability combined with
multi-dimensional conjunctive evaluation criteria---may produce systematic
dysfunction that disadvantages quality research even in the /absence/ of
bias.

The possibility that chance plays a substantial role in peer review is not
new. cite:coleChanceConsensusPeer1981 famously demonstrated that "whether or
not a proposal is funded depends in a large proportion of cases upon which
reviewers happen to be selected for it." Our contribution is to formalize
this intuition and show that high false rejection rates emerge naturally
from subjectivity alone. Using an agent-based simulation calibrated to
empirical reliability data, we demonstrate that at realistic selectivity
levels, a substantial fraction of truly deserving papers are rejected due to
measurement error. This finding validates field wisdom that good papers have
roughly a 50% chance of acceptance at top journals. More troublingly, we
show that this error structure creates perverse incentives: researchers
maximize expected publications by producing multiple "very good" papers
rather than single "excellent" papers, explaining the prevalence of
incremental research and fragmentation strategies documented in the
literature.

The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section [[#model]] develops
a formal model of peer review as noisy signal extraction. Section
[[#simulation]] describes our simulation design and calibration to empirical
data. Section [[#results]] presents results on false rejection rates,
researcher incentives, and interaction effects. Section [[#discussion]]
discusses implications for accounting journals and possible reforms. Section
[[#conclusion]] concludes.

* A Model of Peer Review
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: model
:END:

** Setup

We model peer review as a noisy signal extraction problem. A paper $i$ has
true quality on $D$ dimensions:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{Q}_i = (q_{i1}, q_{i2}, \ldots, q_{iD})
\end{equation}
where each dimension might represent interest, rigor, contribution, or other
evaluation criteria. We assume true quality on each dimension is drawn from
a normal distribution:
\begin{equation}
q_{id} \sim N(\mu, \tau^2)
\end{equation}
where $\mu$ is mean quality in the submission pool and $\tau^2$ is the
variance of true quality across papers.

** Reviewer Observation

Reviewer $j$ observes paper $i$'s quality on dimension $d$ with measurement
error:
\begin{equation}
\hat{q}_{ijd} = q_{id} + \epsilon_{ijd}
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon_{ijd} \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$ is independent noise. This noise
captures the inherent subjectivity of quality assessment---reasonable
reviewers can disagree about the same paper even without bias.

When $n$ reviewers evaluate a paper, the editor aggregates their assessments
by averaging:
\begin{equation}
\bar{q}_{id} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}\hat{q}_{ijd} = q_{id} + \bar{\epsilon}_{id}
\end{equation}
where $\bar{\epsilon}_{id} \sim N(0, \sigma^2/n)$. Averaging reduces noise
variance by a factor of $n$, but with diminishing returns: going from 1 to 2
reviewers halves the variance, but going from 4 to 5 reduces it by only 20%.

** Calibration to Empirical Reliability

The noise parameter $\sigma$ can be calibrated to empirical inter-rater
reliability data. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is defined
as:
\begin{equation}
ICC = \frac{\tau^2}{\tau^2 + \sigma^2}
\end{equation}
This represents the proportion of observed variance attributable to true
differences between papers rather than measurement error.

cite:bornmannReliabilityGeneralizationStudyJournal2010 conducted a
meta-analysis of 70 reliability coefficients from 48 studies covering 19,443
manuscripts across disciplines. They found a mean ICC of 0.34, indicating
that only about one-third of the variance in reviewer assessments reflects
true quality differences---the remaining two-thirds is measurement error.
Critically, this low reliability was consistent across /all/ disciplines
studied, including economics, natural sciences, medical sciences, and social
sciences.

With ICC = 0.34 and assuming $\tau = 20$ (standard deviation of true quality
in the submission pool), we can solve for the noise parameter:
\begin{equation}
0.34 = \frac{400}{400 + \sigma^2} \implies \sigma^2 \approx 776 \implies \sigma \approx 28
\end{equation}
We use $\sigma = 30$ in our simulation, which is slightly conservative
(implying marginally more noise than the point estimate) and simplifies
interpretation.

** The AND-Gate Acceptance Rule

Journals typically require papers to meet standards on /multiple/
dimensions. We model this as a conjunctive (AND-gate) decision rule: a paper
is accepted if and only if its observed quality exceeds the threshold $T$ on
/all/ dimensions:
\begin{equation}
Accept_i = \mathbf{1}\left[\bar{q}_{id} \geq T \text{ for all } d \in \{1,\ldots,D\}\right]
\end{equation}

This AND-gate structure has important implications for error rates. Consider
a paper with true quality $q_{id} = T + \delta$ on all dimensions---that is,
a paper that genuinely deserves acceptance by margin $\delta$. The
probability that observed quality falls below the threshold on any single
dimension is:
\begin{equation}
P(\bar{q}_{id} < T) = \Phi\left(\frac{-\delta}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}\right)
\end{equation}
where $\Phi(\cdot)$ is the standard normal CDF.

With AND-gating across $D$ independent dimensions, the probability of
acceptance becomes:
\begin{equation}
P(Accept) = \left[1 - \Phi\left(\frac{-\delta}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}\right)\right]^D
\end{equation}

This multiplicative structure is what damages good papers. Even if the
probability of passing on each dimension is high, the joint probability of
passing on /all/ dimensions can be substantially lower. Noise on /any/
dimension can sink a deserving paper.

cite:bornmannReliabilityGeneralizationStudyJournal2010 found that
multi-dimensional rating systems are associated with /lower/ inter-rater
reliability, consistent with this theoretical prediction. More dimensions
mean more opportunities for noise to cause rejection.

** Correct Decision and Error Types

We define a paper as truly deserving acceptance if its true quality exceeds
the threshold on all dimensions:
\begin{equation}
ShouldAccept_i = \mathbf{1}\left[q_{id} \geq T \text{ for all } d \in \{1,\ldots,D\}\right]
\end{equation}

This yields four possible outcomes:
- *True Positive (TP):* Paper should be accepted and is accepted
- *False Positive (FP):* Paper should be rejected but is accepted
- *True Negative (TN):* Paper should be rejected and is rejected
- *False Negative (FN):* Paper should be accepted but is rejected

We focus particularly on the false negative rate (FNR):
\begin{equation}
FNR = \frac{FN}{FN + TP}
\end{equation}
This represents the proportion of deserving papers that are incorrectly
rejected---the rate at which good work is filtered out by noise rather than
quality.

* Simulation Design
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: simulation
:END:

** Implementation

We implement the model described in Section [[#model]] as an agent-based
simulation. For each experimental condition, we generate 1,000 papers with
true quality drawn independently on each dimension from $N(50, 20^2)$.
Reviewers observe each dimension with independent noise drawn from $N(0,
\sigma^2)$, and observations are averaged across reviewers. The editor
applies the AND-gate acceptance rule with threshold $T$.

We vary the following parameters:
- *Number of reviewers ($n$):* 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10
- *Reviewer noise ($\sigma$):* 15, 25, 35 (with baseline 30)
- *Number of dimensions ($D$):* 2, 3, 4
- *Threshold ($T$):* 40, 50, 60, 70

For each parameter combination, we run 20 independent replications and
report averaged results for stability.

The simulation code is implemented in Clojure and is publicly available at
https://github.com/drdebit/publication-sim for replication and extension.

** Baseline Parameters

Our baseline parameters are:
- $n = 2$ reviewers (typical for accounting journals)
- $\sigma = 30$ (calibrated to ICC = 0.34)
- $D = 2$ dimensions (interest and rigor)
- $T = 50$ (moderate selectivity)

We then vary each parameter to examine main effects and interactions.

** Main Finding: False Rejection Rates

#+CAPTION: Effect of Reviewer Count on Decision Quality
| Reviewers | FNR    | FPR    | Accuracy | Reliability |
|-----------+--------+--------+----------+-------------|
|         1 | 51.9%  |  17.6% |    73.8% |       55.8% |
|         2 | 45.0%  |  15.0% |    77.4% |       68.5% |
|         3 | 38.8%  |  13.2% |    80.5% |       75.3% |
|         4 | 37.6%  |  12.4% |    81.4% |       80.2% |
|         5 | 34.5%  |  11.1% |    83.1% |       83.2% |
|         7 | 30.0%  |   9.9% |    85.1% |       86.6% |
|        10 | 27.7%  |   9.3% |    86.3% |       90.2% |

Our primary finding is that under realistic conditions, a substantial
proportion of deserving papers are rejected due to measurement error alone.
With 2 reviewers (the accounting norm), approximately 45% of papers that
should be accepted are rejected (FNR = 0.45).

The effect of reviewer count exhibits clear diminishing returns. Going from
1 to 2 reviewers reduces FNR by 6.9 percentage points---the largest single
improvement. Going from 2 to 5 reviewers provides another 10.5 percentage
point reduction. Beyond 5 reviewers, gains are marginal.

This finding is consistent with cite:esareyDoesPeerReview2017, who found
that papers at the 80th percentile of quality face essentially coin-flip
odds of acceptance. Our simulation provides a mechanism for this finding:
the combination of low inter-rater reliability and multi-dimensional
evaluation.

** The AND-Gate Effect: Dimensions Amplify Errors

#+CAPTION: Effect of Evaluation Dimensions (AND-gating)
| Dimensions | FNR    | FPR   | Accuracy |
|------------+--------+-------+----------|
|          2 | 45.3%  | 15.3% |    77.1% |
|          3 | 60.0%  |  8.5% |    85.1% |
|          4 | 70.5%  |  4.5% |    91.6% |

Adding evaluation dimensions dramatically increases false rejection rates.
With 2 dimensions, FNR is approximately 45%. With 3 dimensions, FNR rises
to 60%. With 4 dimensions, FNR reaches 71%.

This occurs because each additional dimension is another opportunity for
noise to cause rejection. A paper must clear the threshold on /every/
dimension, so noise on /any/ dimension can sink it. This AND-gate structure
is particularly punishing for borderline-good papers.

** Selective Journals Face Higher Baseline FNR

#+CAPTION: Threshold × Noise Interaction
| Threshold | Noise SD | Accuracy | FNR    | FPR   |
|-----------+----------+----------+--------+-------|
|        40 |       15 |    82.0% | 21.1%  | 15.1% |
|        40 |       25 |    74.1% | 33.5%  | 18.8% |
|        40 |       35 |    68.3% | 42.0%  | 22.2% |
|        50 |       15 |    85.6% | 29.2%  |  9.4% |
|        50 |       25 |    79.8% | 41.5%  | 13.2% |
|        50 |       35 |    75.2% | 49.1%  | 16.6% |
|        60 |       15 |    91.9% | 34.8%  |  5.2% |
|        60 |       25 |    88.3% | 47.4%  |  8.2% |
|        60 |       35 |    84.9% | 55.2%  | 10.9% |
|        70 |       15 |    96.9% | 39.2%  |  2.1% |
|        70 |       25 |    94.8% | 48.9%  |  4.2% |
|        70 |       35 |    92.5% | 54.8%  |  6.2% |

An important finding for top accounting journals: highly selective journals
(high threshold) have /higher baseline/ false negative rates. Even with low
noise (SD = 15), a threshold of 70 yields an FNR of 39%---nearly double the
21% at a lenient threshold of 40. At high noise (SD = 35), selective
journals reach an FNR of 55%.

This occurs because selective journals are making decisions among papers
clustered near the high end of quality. Most truly deserving papers are only
marginally above threshold, making them vulnerable to downward noise. At
lenient journals, there is more separation between deserving and undeserving
papers, so noise is less likely to cause misclassification.

** Quality vs. Volume: Perverse Incentives

Our simulation reveals that the noisy structure of peer review creates
incentives favoring quantity over quality. We compare four hypothetical
strategies for a researcher with fixed total effort (at threshold = 70, 2
reviewers, noise SD = 30):

#+CAPTION: Strategy Comparison: Quality vs. Volume
| Strategy       | Papers | Quality | P(Accept) | E[Publications] |
|----------------+--------+---------+-----------+-----------------|
| Two very good  |      2 |      78 |     40.9% |            0.82 |
| Three decent   |      3 |      68 |     20.0% |            0.60 |
| Two good       |      2 |      72 |     28.5% |            0.57 |
| One excellent  |      1 |      85 |     56.4% |            0.56 |

The "two very good" strategy dominates "one excellent" by 46% in expected
publications, despite producing lower-quality work. This occurs because the
stochastic nature of acceptance rewards multiple attempts. Even if each
individual paper has lower acceptance probability, the portfolio effect of
multiple submissions increases expected output.

This finding helps explain several observed phenomena in accounting
research:
- The prevalence of "salami-slicing" (fragmenting research into minimal
  publishable units)
- Field wisdom to "write twice as many papers as you think you need"
- The trend toward more incremental contributions noted by
  cite:burtonPerceptionsAccountingAcademics2024

The incentive structure we document may also discourage scientific
risk-taking. cite:azoulayDoesPeerReview2025 provide evidence that peer
review penalizes researchers who pursue bold, unconventional work. Our
simulation suggests a mechanism: innovative research may face higher
variance in reviewer assessments (less consensus on what "good" looks like),
amplifying the AND-gate effect and making conservative, incremental work
relatively more attractive.

** Interaction: Reviewers Help More When Noise Is High

#+CAPTION: Reviewers × Noise Interaction
| Noise SD | Reviewers | Accuracy | FNR    |
|----------+-----------+----------+--------|
|       15 |         1 |    82.1% | 35.8%  |
|       15 |         2 |    85.6% | 28.3%  |
|       15 |         3 |    88.3% | 24.3%  |
|       15 |         5 |    89.9% | 21.0%  |
|       25 |         1 |    75.8% | 49.0%  |
|       25 |         2 |    79.7% | 39.9%  |
|       25 |         3 |    81.8% | 36.1%  |
|       25 |         5 |    84.9% | 30.3%  |
|       35 |         1 |    72.6% | 54.6%  |
|       35 |         2 |    75.6% | 48.1%  |
|       35 |         3 |    78.0% | 44.0%  |
|       35 |         5 |    81.2% | 37.4%  |

We find a significant interaction between reviewer count and noise level:
additional reviewers provide greater benefit when individual reviewer noise
is high. At low noise (SD = 15), going from 1 to 5 reviewers improves
accuracy by 7.8 percentage points. At high noise (SD = 35), the same change
improves accuracy by 8.6 percentage points.

This has implications for fields with particularly subjective evaluation
criteria. If accounting reviews involve more subjectivity than, say,
statistical analysis in finance, then accounting journals would benefit
/more/ from additional reviewers than journals in more objective fields.

** Interaction: Reviewers Help More With Multi-Dimensional Evaluation

#+CAPTION: Reviewers × Dimensions Interaction
| Dimensions | Reviewers | Accuracy | FNR    | FPR   |
|------------+-----------+----------+--------+-------|
|         2D |         1 |    73.5% | 52.7%  | 18.0% |
|         2D |         2 |    77.5% | 45.4%  | 14.9% |
|         2D |         3 |    79.8% | 41.0%  | 13.1% |
|         2D |         5 |    83.3% | 34.4%  | 10.8% |
|         3D |         1 |    82.8% | 69.6%  |  9.5% |
|         3D |         2 |    85.5% | 59.6%  |  8.0% |
|         3D |         3 |    86.5% | 54.6%  |  7.6% |
|         3D |         5 |    88.5% | 45.0%  |  6.7% |
|         4D |         1 |    90.4% | 78.3%  |  5.0% |
|         4D |         2 |    91.1% | 70.0%  |  4.6% |
|         4D |         3 |    92.0% | 64.6%  |  4.1% |
|         4D |         5 |    92.9% | 56.6%  |  3.7% |

Similarly, additional reviewers provide greater benefit when papers are
evaluated on more dimensions. With 2-dimensional evaluation, going from 1 to
5 reviewers reduces FNR by 18.3 percentage points. With 4-dimensional
evaluation, the same change reduces FNR by 21.7 percentage points.

This suggests that journals with comprehensive, multi-criteria evaluation
should invest in more reviewers to compensate for the AND-gate effect.

** Supplemental Analysis: The Editor's Role

#+CAPTION: Editor as Partial Reviewer (Supplemental)
| Model              | Reviewers | Editor SD | FNR    | Accuracy |

| Editor-as-reviewer |         2 |        50 | 45.7%  |    77.0% |
| Editor-as-reviewer |         2 |        60 | 47.6%  |    76.1% |
| Main model         |         2 |       n/a | 45.0%  |    77.7% |
| Editor-as-reviewer |         3 |        50 | 41.0%  |    80.0% |
| Editor-as-reviewer |         3 |        60 | 43.5%  |    78.5% |
| Main model         |         3 |       n/a | 40.2%  |    79.7% |

In supplemental analysis, we examine whether editors should contribute their
own quality assessments to the reviewer average. We model the editor as an
additional reviewer with higher noise (SD = 50-60) reflecting their
shallower engagement with any single paper.

Counterintuitively, adding the editor's noisy assessment /reduces/ decision
quality. With 2 reviewers alone, accuracy is 77.7%. Adding an editor with SD
= 60 reduces accuracy to 76.1%. This occurs because averaging in a noisy
signal dilutes the more reliable reviewer assessments.

This finding supports treating the editor's role as distinct from reviewers:
editors should aggregate and interpret reviewer signals rather than adding
their own noisy quality assessment to the average.

** Reframing the Problem

Our findings suggest a reframing of the accounting publication "problem."
The conventional view attributes publication difficulties to reviewer
bias---topic preferences, methodological prejudice, or favoritism. While
bias surely exists, our simulation demonstrates that high false rejection
rates and perverse incentives emerge naturally from the /structure/ of peer
review even without any bias.

This reframing has important implications. If the problem were primarily
bias, solutions would focus on reviewer training, blind review, or
diversifying reviewer pools. But if the problem is structural noise,
different interventions are needed. Indeed,
cite:hesselbergReviewerTrainingImproving2023 conducted a systematic review of
reviewer training interventions and found that training produces "little or
no improvement in peer review quality."

** Policy Implications for Accounting Journals

Our findings suggest several directions for accounting journals:

1. *Consider adding reviewers.* The largest accuracy gains come from going 1
   to 2 reviewers, but meaningful improvements continue through 3-5
   reviewers. If accounting journals typically use 1-2 reviewers, there is
   accuracy left on the table.

2. *Be cautious about multi-dimensional evaluation.* Comprehensive rubrics
   with many criteria may /reduce/ decision quality by creating more
   opportunities for noise to reject good papers. Journals might consider
   compensatory rather than conjunctive decision rules, or fewer evaluation
   dimensions.

3. *Acknowledge noise exists.* Our findings suggest that roughly half of
   rejection decisions for borderline-good papers are determined by noise
   rather than true quality. This has implications for how journals
   communicate with authors and how authors interpret rejection.

4. *Consider structural interventions.* Given that training doesn't improve
   reliability, journals might explore structural changes: lottery elements
   for borderline papers, registered reports that separate evaluation of
   questions from evaluation of results, or multi-stage review that filters
   on different dimensions sequentially rather than conjunctively.

** Limitations

Our simulation makes several simplifying assumptions. We model reviewer
noise as independent and identically distributed, but in reality reviewers
may have correlated biases (e.g., methodological preferences). We assume
dimensions are independent, but true quality may be correlated across
dimensions. We assume a simple averaging aggregation rule, but editors may
weight reviewers differently.

These simplifications likely make our estimates /conservative/. Correlated
reviewer errors would not average out as effectively. Correlated dimensions
would amplify the AND-gate effect. Non-uniform weighting could either help
or hurt depending on whether editors correctly identify reliable reviewers.

We also do not model the full publication ecosystem, including resubmission
to other journals, desk rejection, or strategic author behavior. Future work
could extend the simulation to capture these dynamics.

* Conclusion
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: conclusion
:END:

We develop a model of peer review as noisy signal extraction and use
simulation to examine its implications for false rejection rates and
researcher incentives. Calibrating to empirical inter-rater reliability data
(ICC = 0.34), we find that under realistic conditions, a substantial
proportion of deserving papers are rejected due to measurement error alone.
The combination of low reliability, multi-dimensional evaluation, and high
selectivity creates a system that systematically rejects good work---not
because reviewers are biased, but because the signal-to-noise ratio is low.

This finding has implications for how we interpret and reform the
publication process. The problem is not primarily bad reviewers; it is a
structurally noisy system. Even well-intentioned actors produce high false
rejection rates when reliability is low and standards are high. Recognizing
this shifts attention from reviewer training (which doesn't work) to
structural interventions: more reviewers, different decision rules, or
explicit acknowledgment of uncertainty.

Our simulation also reveals that noise creates perverse incentives.
Researchers maximize expected publications by fragmenting their work into
more, lower-quality papers rather than concentrating effort on fewer,
higher-quality papers. This helps explain the prevalence of incremental
research and "salami-slicing" documented in the literature.

We hope this paper contributes to a more nuanced conversation about peer
review in accounting. The frustration documented by
cite:burtonPerceptionsAccountingAcademics2024 is real, but attributing it
primarily to bias may misdirect reform efforts. Understanding the structural
sources of dysfunction is a first step toward designing more effective
knowledge production systems.
